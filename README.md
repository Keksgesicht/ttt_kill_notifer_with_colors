Original Addon is: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=305575144 (_TTT Kill reveal / Kill notifier with colors_)
my version of it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=891062391 (_kill notifer with colors (bug fixed)_)

- I fixed a bug with http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639521512 (TTT Boomerang).     
Someone who get killed by the boomerang doesn't move to Spectator.

- The same Bug happens with http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=611873052 (TTT Mirror Fate).    
Also fixed. 

I hope it fixes Bugs with other special Traitor items too.
